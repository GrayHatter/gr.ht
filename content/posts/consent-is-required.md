As I sit here trying to write this intro, I wonder how many more times someone
is going to remind me exactly how important consent is, or remind me how easy it
is to lose sight over how much influence any individual has over another. In
addition to how easy it is to miss the connections between some action and it's
outcome; the more layers of indirection required as any system increase in size,
the harder it becomes to even describe how, or who plays which part. The ease at
which anyone might forget, or how the difficulty grows as the system becomes
more complex, doesn't seem to be the part that irks me. Sadly, the more I look
for it, the more I see software engineers, or the systems they drive, ignore
consent. This is bad, and collectively we should be embarrassed enough to do
something.

Opinions differ[^difficulty] on what exactly counts as consent. I'd venture to
guess it gets even more complicated when it comes to software. I'm sure that
contributes to why TOS are so unparseable by people required to agree to them,
that there's even a website dedicated to explaining common ones[^dislike]. What
does consent look like when it's software in between? If someone continues to
use the software, isn't that consent? No, it's not. 

[^difficulty]: Mine don't; clearly communicated agreement with disclosure. It's
    not hard, **consider the other human too!**

[^dislike]: It's [TOS;DR](https://tosdr.org/), which I elect to only link here
    because I disagree with a number of it's conclusions and assertions. I still
    applaud the attempt.
