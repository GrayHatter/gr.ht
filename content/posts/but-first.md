I don't know who needs to read this, But warnings go **BEFORE** the
content/instructions they're connected to. A distant second, is *immediately*
after the specific connected content. At the very end of the documentation is
about equivalent to not including any warnings.

I had a fear, one I admittedly didn't pay enough attention to, in the back of my
mind, so I thought to read the docs first to be sure I didn't use the wrong
flag... I thought that would protect me. 

This is what I saw...

Cool, I can save myself a step! Unfortunately, I didn't scroll down, so this is
what I did **not** see.

I'll miss that data...

Twice, is enough for me... This site is built with Hugo now. Because *it*
doesn't destroy data that it doesn't need to[^1]. And if you're writing data
destruction warnings, make sure you don't bury them "below the fold".
